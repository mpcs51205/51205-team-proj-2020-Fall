Our design is better that that of eBay in a way that user functions not only include what eBay currently has but have some other fucntions that eBay does not have. Current design allows users to flag an item as inappropriate or counterfeit. While eBay only allows users to close their account, we offer another option of temporarily suspending an account. In case that a user may want to return to our product later, they do not need to create a new account.
